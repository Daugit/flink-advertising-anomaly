# Flink-advertising-anomaly

This project was written by Olivier Randavel and Louis Fontaine

The goal of this school project is to detect anomalies from advertising events (clicks & displays) from Criteo data, using a streaming flow from Kafka and creating a real-time alerting job with Flink.

This repository gathers our flink implementation under the "orlf" directory. 
We advise the reader to start with the python notebook named "Exploration&Results.ipynb". This python notebook describes our method to identify the uids and ip to remove. Also, it shows that the Flink implementation is successful.
